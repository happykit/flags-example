This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to show [@happykit/flags](https://github.com/happykit/flags) usage.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### .env.local

Usually you wouldn't commit `.env.local` to the repository. It's done here to show the setup as the contained client id is public anyhow.

You can replace it with your own client id if you want to see feature toggle features. Sign up for free at https://happykit.dev/signup and create a project. Then, in your project, go to "Settings" > "Keys" and copy your "Development Flags Id" under "Flags".
